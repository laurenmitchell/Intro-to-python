# Due 11/13: Reading a .txt file
# Let’s see how often Taylor Swift says the word “love” in her songs.
# First, read in the .txt file provided to you on Github.
# Create a for loop to write count how many times the word “love” occurs
# need to split lines of words
# Read each line from the file and split the line to form a list of words.
# Check if the word provided by the user and any of the words in the list are equal and if they are, increment the word count.
# So, you will need to create “nested” for loop (two for loops)
